        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
        transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
        and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
        and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
        it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
        compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
        "What's happened to me? " he thought.</p>
